## RES Requirements
- Wrap tool in an API to enable communication with SMARTStop.
- Simulate a noise campaign and compare flow time and production loss to pre existing noise campaign data.
- Train data on a specific French windfarm's site data to potentially test run the tool when a real noise campaign is scheduled to run.

## Clarifications
- We do not need to forecast the ActivePowerMean time series, we don't care about energy yield when making decisions.
- The decision to stop the turbines is based on the average wind speed and wind direction.
- The histogram bins are 2D, each bin has a wind speed and wind direction range.
- We should aim for the flow time of a noise campaign to not grow more than 5%-10%.
- The turbines are either all paused or all running at the same time.

## Actions
Eric will send me data from the French site they wish to test run this tool on and will also send me and example of the histogram produce during a noise campaign.
